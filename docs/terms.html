      <h2>Informational Use Only</h2>
      <p>
        PacePlan is an informational planning aid. It is not a medical device, not a healthcare service,

        PacePlan is provided "as is" and "as available," without warranties of any kind, express or implied,

      </p>

      <h2>Assumption of Risk</h2>
      <p>
        Endurance training carries inherent risk. You are solely responsible for your training decisions,
        physical condition, and safety. You should consult a qualified physician before beginning or
        modifying a training program.
      </p>

      <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, PacePlan and its creators are not liable for injuries,
        health complications, damages, losses, or any other claims arising from use of the app or
        reliance on its content.
      </p>

      <h2>Common Sense and Personal Responsibility</h2>
      <p>
        You agree to use common sense, monitor your condition, and stop training when symptoms,
        pain, or adverse conditions are present.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to Terms</h2>
      <p>
        We may revise these Terms from time to time. Continued use after updates constitutes acceptance
